# DeltaShell Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Features
- Parse input commands by phase.
- Support local execution (localhost) and remote SSH execution.
- Implement SCP between phases for file transfers.
- Transformer system with plugin-friendly pipeline.
- Built-in example transformers (env setup, logging, filtering).
- Config loading from `.deltarc.json` for phase/SSH/color/gate definitions.
- Logic gates for blocking commands per phase.
- Color-coded terminal output per phase.
- Graceful shutdown and SSH session cleanup.

## Phase 2: Extensibility & Plugin Ecosystem
- Define plugin API for custom transformers.
- Dynamic plugin registration/loading.
- Add advanced transformers (format converters, filters, logging).
- Support serial and parallel execution modes.
- Improve command queue with async handling and timeouts.

## Phase 3: Advanced Security & Authentication
- Secure SSH session management (key-based auth, session pooling).
- Command sandboxing and auditing.
- Optional encrypted transformers with strong encryption.
- Enhanced gate logic with role-based access control.

## Phase 4: UI/UX Improvements
- Enhanced CLI features (history, tab completion, syntax highlighting).
- Interactive session and transformer pipeline management.
- Logging and monitoring dashboards.
- Support for zsh/bash plugin integration.

## Phase 5: Distributed Orchestration & Automation
- Multi-node workflow orchestration.
- Conditional execution and event triggers.
- Scheduling and automation support.
- CI/CD tool integration.
- API for external programmatic control.
- Distributed logging and error handling.

## Phase 6: Scaling & Performance
- Load balancing SSH connections.
- Optimize command dispatch latency.
- Support for large-scale deployments.
- High availability and failover.

## Bonus: Experimental & Future Ideas
- Graphical visual shell for command flow and transformers.
- AI-driven command suggestions and auto-fixes.
- Self-healing command pipelines.
- Blockchain-backed audit trails.
- Security honeypot phases.
